# Machine Learning Internship Tasks

This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning tasks assigned during my internship. Each task focuses on a specific problem, such as age detection, drowsiness detection, nationality prediction, and more. Below is a detailed overview of the tasks and instructions to set up and run the code.

## Project Overview
This project consists of 10 machine learning tasks, each addressing a unique problem. The tasks range from fine-tuning pre-trained models for age detection to building real-time systems for drowsiness detection and sign language recognition. The code is implemented using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.
